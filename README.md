<h2>LAB 1. IRIS Dataset Analysis</h2>
<p>
 Download the Iris flower dataset or any other dataset into a DataFrame. (eg
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris ) <br><strong>Use Python/R and Perform following- </strong><br>
<li>How many features are there and what are their types (e.g., numeric, nominal)?</li>
<li>Compute and display summary statistics for each feature available in the dataset.</li>
(eg. minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard deviation, variance
and percentiles</li>
<li> Data Visualization-Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the
feature distributions. Plot each histogram.</li>
<li>Create a boxplot for each feature in the dataset. All of the boxplots should be
combined into a single plot. Compare distributions and identify outliers.</li>
</p>

<h2>LAB 2. Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset Analysis <u>(<b>W.I.P</b>)</ul></h2>
<p>
 Download Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. Use Naive Bayesâ€Ÿ Algorithm for classification.<br>
 <li>Load the data from CSV file and split it into training and test datasets.</li>
 <li>summarize the properties in the training dataset so that we can calculate
  probabilities and make predictions.</li>
 <li>Classify samples from a test dataset and a summarized training dataset.</li>
