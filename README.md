(eg. minimum value, maximum value, mean, range, standard deviation, variance

<li> Data Visualization-Create a histogram for each feature in the dataset to illustrate the
feature distributions. Plot each histogram.</li>
<li>Create a boxplot for each feature in the dataset. All of the boxplots should be
combined into a single plot. Compare distributions and identify outliers.</li>
